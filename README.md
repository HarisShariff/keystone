Small. Strong. Foundational.

Keystone is a lightweight, open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) system for Go.
It provides a clean, embeddable alternative to bulky solutions like Keycloak, perfect for internal systems such as hospitals, manufacturing setups, and SMEs.

Keystone supports:

- HTTP server mode (expose IAM APIs).
- Go library mode (embed directly into your services).

Built with clean architecture principles, secure token handling, and modular design.

## Features

- Dual Operation Modes: HTTP server or Go library.
- Clean Architecture: Transport and storage separated via interfaces.
- Secure Authentication: Password hashing (bcrypt), JWT access/identity tokens.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Simple and extensible role support.
- Pluggable Storage: Oracle database backend (PostgreSQL and others in future).
- Dockerized Deployment: Lightweight container image.
- Minimal External Dependencies: Standard library preferred.

## Why Keystone?

Keystone is designed for developers and teams who need lightweight, secure, and embeddable Identity and Access Management (IAM) ‚Äî without the heavy baggage of traditional solutions like Keycloak or Auth0.

Our focus is simple:

- **Lightweight and embeddable**: Keystone can run as a standalone HTTP server or be embedded directly as a Go library inside your services.
- **Security-first foundation**: We provide secure password hashing, JWT token issuance, and role-based access control without external dependencies.
- **Designed for SMEs and Internal Systems**: Perfect for back-office medical groups, manufacturing units, and SMEs where simplicity, speed, and security matter more than complex external SSO integrations.
- **Extendable for the future**: While our core remains lightweight, Keystone is designed to evolve ‚Äî future modules like OAuth2, SSO, and MFA can be added without sacrificing the clean, modular architecture.

Keystone exists for those who need an identity system that is **small, strong, and foundational** ‚Äî not one that demands you bring a battleship to a fishing trip.

## Getting Started

Run as HTTP Server

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/HarisShariff/keystone:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/HarisShariff/keystone:latest
```

Use as Go Library

```bash
go get github.com/HarisShariff/keystone
```

```go
import "github.com/HarisShariff/keystone"

func main() {
    ks := keystone.New()
    userID, err := ks.RegisterUser("username", "password")
    // handle err, use userID
}
```
